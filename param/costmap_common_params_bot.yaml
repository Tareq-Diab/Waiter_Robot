#These parameters set thresholds on obstacle information
#put into the costmap. The "obstacle_range" parameter determines 
#the maximum range sensor reading that will result in an obstacle 
#being put into the costmap. Here, we have it set at 2.5 meters, 
#which means that the robot will only update its map with information 
#about obstacles that are within 2.5 meters of the base. The "raytrace_range" 
#parameter determines the range to which we will raytrace freespace given a 
#sensor reading. Setting it to 3.0 meters as we have above means that the robot 
#will attempt to clear out space in front of it up to 3.0 meters away given a sensor reading.
